# Ski Resort Ticket Prediction
Big Mountain Ski Resort, located in Montana, provides all-level ski/snowboarding trails and accommodations with 350K visitors each year. The resort has recently installed a new chair lift with $1.5M per year/winter season. The management has considered reducing operational costs or increasing the ticket price to maintain profit. The management team retained the new data science team to study investigate what approaches can be taken to remain profitable while operational costs have increased because of the new lift tickets. The database manager provided a dataset that included about 330 American Ski Resortâ€™s information. The dataset included various information, e.g. Location, Elevation Drop, Lifts, Runs, Snow Making Coverage, Ticket pricing, etc. By processing, analyzing, and modelling the dataset, the ticket price was studied, and recommendations were made to the management for options that may be able to retain the profitability of the resort after the new chair lift is installed.
